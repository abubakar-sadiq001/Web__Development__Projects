                "I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I"ve been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and foound it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 week was the best - and most gruelilng - time of my life. since completing the course, I"ve successfully switched careers as a software Engineer as a VR startup."

                "Before joining the bootcamp, I"ve never written a line of code." I needed some structure from proffessionals who can help me Learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They  were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistence. The agile team project in particular, was outstanding it took my Learning to the next Level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. in fact, I"ve often refered to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. it certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after recieving multipul offers. 100% recommended!"
